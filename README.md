## `playurl` â€“ a console player launcher with URL handling

This script has been written mainly for piping purposes to be able to pass playable URLs to a player without switching to it. In can be used on the command line as well.
It doesn't play anything by itself but rather checks the passed URL and modifies it if needed, then creates a temporary playlist file and passes it the the selected player app/command.  
The script utilizes `yt-dlp` or `youtube-dl` to get audio streams URL from a passed YouTube video URL, thus allowing to play YouTube videos as audio-only using players that don't support YouTube URLs natively.
Local paths could be used instead of URLs.

## Dependencies

  `apt install yt-dlp` to install on Debian GNU/Linux

Other tools and commands used in script which should be included in any default installation: `awk`, `basename`, `cp`, `date`, `file`, `grep`, `kill`, `killall`, `mkdir`, `nohup`, `pgrep`, `ps`, `sed`, `touch`, `tput`, `tr`, `wc`, `which`, `xargs`.

Supported players: IINA, MOC, mpv, mplayer, SMPlayer, VLC, nvlc. These can temporarely override the user-defined default player, which can be any player, not only the one from the list (it should be able to accept URLs as arguments).
